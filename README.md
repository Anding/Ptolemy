The Roman astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, living in Egypt in the second century, is reputed to have written about his motivation for his study of the night sky:

*When I trace at my pleasure the windings to and fro of the heavenly bodies, I no longer touch the earth with my feet: I stand in the presence of Zeus himself and take my fill of ambrosia, food of the gods.*
