The CCA-250 is installed at Deep Sky Chile with the "645" focal reducer.  In this configuation the system has a focal length of 890mm, a focal ratio of f/3.6 and an image circle diameter of 60mm

The CCA-250 has a built-in, motorized, computer-controlled focuser which operates by adjusting the position of the secondary mirror.

The CCA-250 focuser electronics is connected to the local PC by USB and appears to the system as a native USB device (i.e. not a Windows COM serial port).  The protocol is not published but there is a reasonable expecation of reverse engineering it whilst operating focuser with the supplied software.
