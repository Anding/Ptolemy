# SQM

SQM refers to the Sky Quality Meter manufactured by Unihedron of Canada.

The Sky Quality Meter is responsible for measuring the darkness of the night sky in magnitudes per square arcsecond (a higher number is darker; above 18.0m is considered dark enough for astrophotography).

The model installed at Deep Sky Chile is the SQM-LU

The SQM is connected to the local PC by USB and appears to the system as a Windows COM serial port.  The SQM use a simple text-based command protocol.
