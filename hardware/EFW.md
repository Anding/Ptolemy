The EFW installed at Deep Sky Chile has 7 slots each of which holds a 2" filter.  The installed filters are Luminescence, Red, Green, Blue, Hydrogen Alpha, Sulphur II, Oxygen III.  Used in combination with the monochrome camera, images taken with separate filters allow a colour composite image to be synthesized at the image processing stage.
